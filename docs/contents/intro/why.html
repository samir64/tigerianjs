        Tigerian's class.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tigerian is completely modular:</strong> You can use each module
        that you
        need and combine
        with other frameworks. Of
        cource Tigerian can be used instead of all of them.
    </li>
    <li>

        system
        easily.
    </li>

        MVW
        framework which can

        UI, Ajax, APIs (REST systems)
        and ...
    </li>

        Tigerian,
        HTML and CSS

        are not required. They

        automatically. Only developers, who want to expand Tigerian, have to know HTML and CSS.
