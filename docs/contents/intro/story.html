    This framework's main structure, designed in 2015. Back then, it contained only UI controls. Main structure just
    deployed on element attributes that proccessed by HTML/CSS/JS.

    In August 2016, we developed first UI controls and first structure and called it Tigerian for first time.
</span>
<span>
    We left the project unfinished for like two years, until August 2018. Then We started developing Tigerian again.

    But this time, we improved the framework and designed the advanced structure. now, in addition to the UI controls,
    this system has some other modules.
