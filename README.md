# Tigerian: Javascript Framework v1.0.0 alpha

Please visit [Tigerian.js Document](https://samir64.github.io/tigerianjs/docs/).

## Introduction and Story

> This framework's main structure, designed in 2015. Back then, it contained only UI controls. Main structure just deployed on element attributes that proccessed by HTML/CSS/JS.
>
> In August 2016, we developed first UI controls and first structure and called it `Tigerian` for first time.
>
> We left the project unfinished for like two years, until August 2018. Then We started developing `Tigerian` again.
>
> But this time, we improved the framework and designed the advanced structure.
> now, in addition to the UI controls, this system has some other modules.
> `Tigerian` is a MVW framework and fully modular.
>
> You can use just `UI` with its children in order to create a web page, or use `ModelView` system with/without `Route` module to manage your website's Views, or any other combination of modules.

Tigerian has 5 special properties

- **Tigerian is a full objective framework:** Everything in Tigerian is inherited from main Tigerian's class.
- **Tigerian is completely modular:** You can use each module that you need and combine with other frameworks. Of cource Tigerian can be used instead of all of them
- **Tigerian is very expandable:** Developers can expand the system easily.
- **Tigerian is a multi-purpose system:** It can be used as MVW framework which can support UI, Ajax, RESTful systems and ...
- **Tigerian works on DOM system:** For programmers that use Tigerian, HTML and CSS skills, are not required. They only have to be experienced in Javascript, and Tigerian takes care of all other parts (HTML and CSS) automatically. Only developers, who want to expand Tigerian, have to use HTML and CSS.
